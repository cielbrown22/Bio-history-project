        <h1><b>Bubonic Plague: Europe 1347-51</b></h1> 
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Also known as Black Death, the plague is an infectious disease that affects rodents,
        certain other animals, and humans. It is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacteria A person usually 
        becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.
        Someone exposed to Yersinia pestis through the air would become ill within 1 to 3 days.</p>
        <p>The Black Death killed 50 million people in the 14th century, or 60 percent of Europe's entire population.
        </p>
        <h4>Types of plagues and how you can get them:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pnuemonic: the only form of the plague that can be transmitted from person to person</li>
            <li>Septicemic: When the bacteria enter the bloodstream directly and multiply there</li>
            <li>Bubonic: infects your lymphatic system (a part of the immune system), causing inflammation 
                in your lymph nodes. Untreated, it can move into the blood or to the lungs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Symptoms of Black Death</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fevers and chills</li>
            <li>Headaches</li>
            <li>Muscle pain</li>
            <li>General weakness</li>
            <li>Seizures</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How is the plague spread?</h3>
        <p>Plague can be spread through bites of infected fleas or rats
        and can also spread through scratches or bites of infected domestic cats.</p>
        <h2>Contained/Treated?</h2>
        <p>Many physicians believed that the plague was spread by miasmas, or corruptions of air, so they
        lit fires. People (even the pope) would burn aromatic wood, carry herbs in the pocket and on their person, and 
        or put glazes on their windows in attempt to "plague-proof" them. People have been advised what not to do
        to avoid catching the plague, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not eatting meat or figs</li>
            <li>Avoid activities that would open the pores to a miasma like:</li>
            <li>Bathing</li>
            <li>Exercising</li>
            <li>Physical intimacy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They also have been warned about strange actions including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not sleeping during the daytime</li>
            <li>Avoiding sad thoughts about death and disease</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although not much is known about mideval cures to the Black Death, it's possible they believed nothing
        could be done. With what little cures are mentioned, they include bloodletting, which was an attempt to draw 
        poison out of the body. And we know some physicians tried to rupture and drain the buboes. Many people have 
        turned to the church as well, praying to God to end their suffering and to heal them. 
        </p>
        <p>Some European countries even turned to quarantining those who they suspected of showing symptoms.
        They would board people into their homes. Some towns built pestilence houses, where the sick could be taken 
        to die. The rich or people who could afford it fled to the countryside. In Venice, Italy, practice of isolating
        ships until it could be determined that no one on board was sick. Holding periods started at 30 days, 
        but when it was determined that wasn't long enough, the wait lengthened to 40 days
        </p>
        <h3>Is this still a problem today?</h3>
        <p>For the most part, no, but as of 2015 there have been 9 reported cases.
        Other than that, it is very much treatable and resolves within days to weeks in todays standards.
