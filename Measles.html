        <h1><b>Measles 2018-19</b></h1>
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>Measles is a very contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads through the air when
             an infected person coughs or sneezes.
            </p>
        <h3>Typical symptoms of Measles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Dry Cough</li>
            <li>Runny Nose</li>
            <li>Sore Throat</li>
            <li>Inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis)</li>
            <li>Tiny white spots with bluish-white centers on a red background found inside the mouth 
            on the inner lining of the cheek, also called Koplik's spots.</li>
        </ul>
         <h3>How it's spread</h3>
            <p>The majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated.
                Measles is still common in many parts of the world including some countries in 
                Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. 
                Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the United States.
                Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.
            </p>
        <h3>How is it prevented/contained/treated?</h3>
            <p>How to prevent Measles</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash your hands often</li>
                <li>If soap and water aren't available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer 
                    (containing at least 60% alcohol).
                </li>
                <li>Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure
                    your hands are clean.
                </li>
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when 
                    coughing or sneezing.
                </li>
                <li>Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils
                or cups, with people who are sick..
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>There is also the MMR vaccine that helps people become immune to the viruses. Although not enforced,
        it is highly recommended.</p>
        <h2>Recent Cases</h2>
        <h3>2019</h3>
        <p>From January 1 to February 14, 2019, 127** individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 
        10 states. The states that have reported cases to CDC are California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
        Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.
            </p>
        <h3>2018</h3>
        <p>The U.S. experienced 17 outbreaks in 2018, including three outbreaks in New York State, 
        New York City, and New Jersey, respectively. Cases in those states occurred primarily among 
        unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities. These outbreaks were associated with travelers 
        who brought measles back from Israel, where a large outbreak is occurring. Eighty-two people brought
        measles to the U.S. from other countries in 2018. This is the greatest number of imported cases since
        measles was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000.
        </p>
        <h2>How epidemiology has changed to help this outbreak</h2>
        <p>As mentioned, there is a vaccine to help prevent development of the disease and build up
        the immune system (being licensed for use in 1971). Since before this, nearly every child got measles by
        the time they were 15. These cases have since decreased (being eliminated in 2000), but with the speculation 
        that vaccines cause autism, many people have become "anti-vaxx" even since the theory has been debunked. 
        With this, a few people have deemed that obtaining the measles is a "right-of-passage" and relying on God to 
        heal their child.
